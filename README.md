# Introduction and guide to use:
This is one of my very first and only use of the discord api.

This bot includes many commands which you can look at in the commands folder.

## Actually using the bot:
Make sure to insert your token and client id into the `config.json` file and customize the bot however you like. to run the bot you can run the batch file included with all the rest of the files.
Before doing all of that you should also install any packages it asks you to install upon first launch of the bot.
